<p class = "paragraph"> Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo,<br>
   in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi <br>
   Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba <br>
   Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward <br>
   of Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1. <br>
<br>
  Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’ valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also<br>
   of making his own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.</p>
